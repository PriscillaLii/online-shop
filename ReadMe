Team, Course Project 

Designed and implemented a web E-Commerce System that can show and buy items.
Used web crawler to collect data from real E-Commerce web site and stored them in local database.
Developed system to support user login, logup, viewing cart, placing order, showing the detail of items, etc.

I built the database and some of the front-end part and also some back-end function.
The design file and requirements analysis is in Chinese(Simplified).
