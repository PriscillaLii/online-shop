Developed a web application of filtering, recommending and searching local restaurants.
Built the recommendation system by analyzing the keywords frequency of the collected comments.
Used MongoDB and Hadoop to store informations as distribution data.

I built the database and some of the front-end part and also some back-end function.
The design file and requirements analysis is in Chinese(Simplified).
